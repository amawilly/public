					An complex world about numbers. <br>
					A big amount of different types of exercises. <br>
					A litle pain when your do not understand it but its a way that forms our mind to solve all the problems which we think are related to the main world. <br>
					A way to improve your logic and your mind: <br>
					○ When you solve some exercises your find out paths to do this: <br>
					○ You are not anymore struggling about how i am gonna do this, but you are going do this because math improve our skills.

					Agriculture: <br>
					In the sector of agriculture, information technology plays a significant role. Temperature, humidity, wind speed, and radiation are all monitored using cutting-edge computer technology, which also allows for a wireless link between mobile devices and the greenhouse. <br>
					Business: <br>
					The use of information technology allows the business community to react rapidly to changes in the environment. It also facilitates the timely arrival of new items on the market. <br>
					Education: <br>
					Teachers may use IT to produce appealing audio and video presentations that will keep students engaged in their studies and help them comprehend ideas better. <br>
					Healthcare: <br>
                    IT is used to spot medical errors in the healthcare sector. Nurses can spend more time on patient care if they spend less time documenting patient care.

				Interview with our IT teacher  <br>
				Dan-Mihai Taking the interview here so what was it about ?
			</h1>
			<p class="name">
				<div class="point">
					-Here's a question.. How will Informatics help us in our day to day life?
                    Why do we need Informatics? <br>
                    -Only Informatics? <br>
                    -Yes only Informatics -Informatics is the one to rule the world.Informatics will rule the world.  <br>
                    -Can you give some arguments supporting this statement? <br>
                    -Yes, we need to understand that through out the Informatics class there are some applications that will help us at diffrent subjects, that would be the first argument, next up if we would learn sistematically, then we would convert the Informatics class into fun things that eventually could reward us with some money. <br>
                    -Alright thank you for your time and thank you for the interview.

				Interview with Math Teacher Ms Tatiana
			</h1>
			<p class="name">
				<div class="point">
					-So, could you answer this question please, what is math's role in our day to day life? <br>
                    -First of all mathematics helps us develop mentally, if you know maths then it is muuch easier to think overall and to get out of a situation. <br>
                    -Mhm, alright, do you have another argument? <br>
                    -Without mathermatics, any other domain wouldn't exist, we use maths in construction, we use math in architecture, we use maths in medicine and we use math in economy so basically so without maths life wouldn't be the same. <br>
                    -Ok, thank you for the atttention, and sorry for disturbing you.

				Conclusion
			</h1>
			<p class="name">
				<div class="point">
					Young children have the capacity and interest to lear meaningful mathematics. Learning such mathmatics enriches their current intellectual and social experiences and lays the foundation for later learning. <br> <br>
					Informatics systems maintain data that equip healthcare providers with access to real-time patient records and medical information, driving critical decision-making to provide the best patient care.
